# Rust Tic Tac Toe with Minimax(AI)

## Description
I made this project to help you understand how the Minimax algorithm works!

I did not implement the alpha-beta pruning, but I probably will.

If you want to know it's theory you can watch these two videos: [Theory Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI) [Tic Tac Toe Minimax Theory](https://youtu.be/trKjYdBASyQ)


## Dev Notes:
- If you want to debug the app you can set the var ``` GAME_DEBUG ``` as true to debug the game, and you can set ``` AI_DEBUG ``` as true to see the minimax depth
