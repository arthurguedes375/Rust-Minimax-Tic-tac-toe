# Rust Tic Tac Toe with Minimax(AI) With Alpha-Beta pruning

## Description
I made this project to help you understand how the Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm works!
If you want to know it's theory you can watch these two videos: [Theory Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI) [Tic Tac Toe Minimax Theory](https://youtu.be/trKjYdBASyQ)


## Dev Notes:
- If you want to debug the app you can set the var ``` GAME_DEBUG ``` as true to debug the game, and you can set ``` AI_DEBUG ``` as true to see the minimax depth
- You can change the AI's depth setting the var ``` AI_DEPTH ``` as the depth that you want the AI to search
